### How to build the project

After cloning the repository, `cd` into the project folder and run:

```
./gradlew build idea
```
This will build the project and add the IntelliJ Idea specific files. 
Afterwards you can import this project into IntelliJ. 

If you are using eclipse, run this command instead:

```
./gradlew build eclipse
```
Similarly, you can import this project into Eclipse.
